Lately, I was wondering how to simplify my current tech stack I'm most comfortable working with. In the past, I worked with typical full-stack application using React and some kind of a backend like Express or Fastify. But how to solve the performance issues when a web app needs to work fast in 2 distinct regions. That's when I discovered Fly.io and LiteFS.

LiteFS is a game-changer for developers using SQLite in Next.js applications with Prisma. This distributed file system is specifically designed to replicate SQLite databases, offering numerous advantages for your web projects. Let's explore why integrating LiteFS into your tech stack is a smart move.

### Minimal Latency, Maximum Performance

LiteFS allows each application node to have a complete, local copy of the database. This setup dramatically reduces latency, as your app can respond to requests almost instantly. For Next.js applications using Prisma as an ORM, this means lightning-fast data access and improved overall performance.

### Real-Time Replication

LiteFS captures SQLite transactions by intercepting file system API calls. It stores these changes in a format called LTX, which allows for:

- Reconstruction of the database state at any point in time

- Real-time replication of changes across your cluster

For Prisma users, this means your data stays consistent across all nodes without additional configuration.

### Seamless Integration with Different Journal Modes

Whether your SQLite setup uses a rollback journal or a write-ahead log (WAL), LiteFS adapts its approach to capture and replicate transactions efficiently. This flexibility ensures compatibility with various SQLite configurations in your Next.js project.

### Intelligent Cluster Management

LiteFS uses a lease system to manage the cluster, designating a single "primary" node for writes. This approach:

- Maintains SQLite's single-writer nature

- Allows for dynamic primary node changes

- Works well in ephemeral environments where cluster membership changes frequently

### Split Brain Prevention

LiteFS employs a rolling checksum of the database contents to detect and resolve split-brain scenarios. This feature prevents data corruption if a node becomes out of sync with the cluster, maintaining data integrity in your Next.js application.

### Future-Proof Your App

While LiteFS currently uses asynchronous replication, plans for synchronous replication and time-bound asynchronous replication are in the works. By adopting LiteFS now, you're setting up your Next.js app for future enhancements.

### Conclusion

Incorporating LiteFS with SQLite in your Next.js app offers significant benefits. From improved performance and high availability to real-time replication and intelligent cluster management, LiteFS provides a robust solution for scaling your database operations. By leveraging these technologies, you're not just building an app â€“ you're creating a resilient, high-performance system ready for growth and change.
